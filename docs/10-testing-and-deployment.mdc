# 10 - Testing and Deployment

## Testing
1. **Unit Tests**  
   - Use `Jest` + `React Testing Library`.
   - Test components (e.g., cart logic, chatbot, forms).
2. **Integration Tests**  
   - Mock API calls or test with a staging environment for PlanetScale, Stripe, etc.
3. **E2E Tests**  
   - Tools like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user interactions.

## Deployment
1. **Hosting**  
   - Popular choices: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or your own server.
   - If using Next.js, you can deploy directly to Vercel.
2. **Environment Variables**  
   - Set environment variables on your hosting platform for secrets (Stripe keys, DB credentials).
3. **Automated Builds**  
   - Configure your Git repo to build and deploy on push to `main` or on a PR merge.

## Next Steps
- Review the entire docs folder for any missing details.
- Start iterating and customizing your code to match real content and brand style.
